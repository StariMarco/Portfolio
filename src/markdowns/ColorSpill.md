## Description

`Color Spill` is an android game developed with Unity that I created to gain experience with publishing apps in the play store. In fact, this game was initially published in the play store, but after a while I decided to remove it since google updated their policy.

The goal of this game is to color the entire playing field with the same color in a limited number of moves. I decided to add a shop and a few extra modes to make it a little more fun and dynamic.

## Features

- 5 different game modes
  - Casual
  - Hexagon: The cells are hexagons insted of squares
  - Reflex: There is only one color picker and the color changes automatically with a delay that gets smaller and smaller as the game goes on
  - Dilemma: The player has to choose between 2 colors to make your move
  - 1 vs 1: A multiplayer mode to play with your friends
- Every game mode (except 1 vs 1) has 3 different difficulties: Easy, Normal and Hard
- Integrated shop where the player can purchase:
  - Coins, remove the adds or double the amount of coins that you receive each game with in-app payments
  - With the coins the player can buy some backgrounds and unlock game modes
