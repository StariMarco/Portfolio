## Description

I wanted to create my `Portfolio` without using any website builder to further improve my development skills and to have the freedom to implement features as I want without any limitations. So I decided to use the JavaScript with the React library since I was already somewhat comfortable with it.

I decided to try out the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) hosting service, which is connected directly to the github project of this portfolio.
