## Description

`Sort Visualizer` is a web app that I decided to create to learn how to use react with redux and to practice using animations.

It consists of a simple ui from which you can decide the type of sorting algorithm you want to visualize and several options on how to display the data.

To design the website faster (since it wasn't the main focus) I decided to use the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) framework which provides some pre-styled components.

## Features

- Sort a list of numbers with 4 different algorithms:
  - Bubble sort
  - Selection sort
  - Merge sort
  - Quick sort
- Regulate the speed at which the animation is displayed
- Define the length of the array to sort and the range of possible values
