  "front-end.text": "Since I was a kid, I‚Äôve always been a fan of order, symmetry and comfort.<br><br>I see programming web or mobile programs/apps as kind of art that reaches its glory when it is easily understood by the user. You also need to keep the various tools in order so that you can find them again and easily understand how they work when you want to reuse them.",
  "back-end.subtitle": "A stunning Front-End is nothing without a solid Back-End.",
  "back-end.text": "The Back-End has never been my main interest, but I‚Äôve always seen it as a key part of my work and therefore I‚Äôve always tried to deepen my knowledge in this sector.",
  "design.subtitle": "I love crafting and studying design to offer the best user experience possible.",
  "design.text": "My interest in design started while creating my first games and apps. I‚Äôve always enjoyed making my projects look pretty as well as functional.<br><br>As a result, alongside my programming studies, I also started studying the basic aspects of design and the psychology behind it.",
