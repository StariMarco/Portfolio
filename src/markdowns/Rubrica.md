## Description

Everyone knows how challenging it can be to manually **keep your contact details up to date**. If a friend or colleague decides to change their phone number or email, there's no other way to know than to ask them directly.

`Rubrica` is a iOS & Android app which aims to solve this problem by automatically keeping your contacts' data in sync.

It also lets you **classify your information by category** so that you can show particular information only to those who need it. For example, I can share to a client only business information and to a friend only personal information.

## Features

- Share your data with other users through a qr code.
- Decide what information a user is allowed to see.
- Keep your contacts' data always in sync.
- If you want to see the data of the contacts that are locally stored on your phone, you are able to do so.
- Press and hold on a contact information to perform an action (depending on the type of the information you can: call a number, send an email, copy the text, open google maps ecc...)
