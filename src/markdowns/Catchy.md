## Description

`Catchy` is an pc game created to learn how to use Unity. In this game the objective of every level is to:

1. Kill enough enemies to get a rainbow bullet
2. Destroy the golden gate with rainbow bullet to unlock the boss fight
3. Kill the boss to get the key to open the trapdoor and advance to the next level

Unfortunately this game has never been finished because I was a bit lost with other projects (such as Color Spill). Only the first level is playable until the bossfight.
