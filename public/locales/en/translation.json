  "front-end.subtitle": "I like to turn abstract concepts into something real through a GUI :)",
  "front-end.text": "Since I was a kid, I‚Äôve always been a fan of order, symmetry and comfort.<br><br>I see creating web or mobile programs/applications as somewhat of an art that reaches its glory when the product is easily understood and used by the end user. At the same time, keeping the code clean and efficient is essential to make the product open to new features or changes.",
  "back-end.subtitle": "A stunning Front-End is nothing without a solid Back-End.",
  "back-end.text": "The Back-End has never been my main interest, but I‚Äôve always seen it as a key part of my work and therefore I‚Äôve always tried to deepen my knowledge in this sector.",
  "design.subtitle": "I love crafting and studying design to offer the best user experience possible.",
  "design.text": "My interest in design started while creating my first games and apps. I‚Äôve always enjoyed making my projects look pretty as well as functional.<br><br>As a result, alongside my programming studies, I also started studying the basic aspects of design and the psychology behind it.",
